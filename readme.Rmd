#Curation table
Key elements: 
Drug, Disease, Enrichment biomarker, Biomarker relationship,	Biomarker logical conditions,	Marker type

#################
#Merged Table
#drug: drug name directly taken from the raw text
#drug_drugbank_standard: drug drugbank ID; NA: means unmapped; The drug that has not been approved may not have drugbank id.
#drug_pubchem: drug PubChem Compound ID; if the drug is a biological entity, it may have not PubChem Compound ID
#biomarker: biomarker names taken from the raw text; mostly are related to gene, occationally related to protein target (antibody name), metabolite or other entities
#biomarker_ensembl_standard: biomarker ensembl id (mapped through open target APIs), some mappings might not be accurate as opentarget using a similarity matching; non-gene-biomarkers may not have ensembl id
#biomarker_type: ~16 biomarker types were summarized such as gene expression, protein expression, mutation.
#biomarker_direction: postive or negative. For mutation, positive means the patient should harbor this mutation; for protein expression, positive means the patient should have highly expressed protein.
#biomarker_relations: The relation between multiple biomarkers. AND: patients should present both biomarkers; OR: patients present either of the biomarkers
#biomarker_description: a summary of the biomarker description ( a combination of biomarker name, type, direction, and relations). It should be more understandable.
#disease: disease taken from the raw text
#diseases_id_standard: disease ID mapped to EFO/MONDO(Monarch Disease) via opentarget API. Similarity matching was performed, only the top disease was selected; many of the mappings are problematic so should be used in caution.
#drug_targets: drug targets taken from the raw text. We only add the targets mentioned in the text.
#curator
#raw_table: raw_table provided by the curator
#source: FDA, clinicaltrials.gov or PubMed
#source ID: FDA source IDs are the same as taken from the same website. clinicaltrials.gov: clinical trial ID, PubMed: PubMed ID
